# Data Language Templates

Compiled high performance templates allowing loops, conditions, bean property access, etc.

See docs under: https://studio42gmbh.github.io/dlt/

The ANTLR grammar can be found here: https://github.com/studio42gmbh/dlt/tree/main/src/main/antlr4/de/s42/dlt/parser/antlr

## Motivation

Allowed me to have high performance template evaluation which is not interpreted but precompiled. 
The syntax itself is intended to blend well with many other language formats.

Have a great day!
